We developed a state-of-health estimation method for lithium-ion batteries using a data-driven multi-model fusion approach. By combining machine learning models and a Kalman filter, our approach provides accurate and robust health estimates under varied operating conditions, enabling safer and more reliable battery management in electric vehicles.
